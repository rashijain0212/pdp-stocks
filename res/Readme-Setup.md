## About Readme

This Readme comprise all the setup required by the project.

## Setup

* Java 18 and JDK 11 required.

* The jar file can work only from the res folder, as the stock data files are there.

* All the stock data retrieved is in res/stockData.

* For now, jar file is in the folder res.

* Project Structure is as follows:

* We are using stock data of 13 companies ranging from dates 02-02-2001 to 10-25-2022 (mm-dd-yyyy).

* The new created portfolios are saved in the parent of current working directory in portfolios (a
  new folder created).

* Each text file uploaded by the user as input should contain only one portfolio.

* While uploading the file, the user should give the full path of the file like - C:
  \Users\96ras\Desktop\stocks\src\stockData\abc.txt

* The files created using this program is read only, so if you try to create another portfolio with
  same name, it will not be overwritten. Nothing will happen if you use already existing portfolio
  name.
